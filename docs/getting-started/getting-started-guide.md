# Introductory Videos

Pierre DeBelen, the creator of Legend, delivered the [keynote speech at 2020 Open Source Strategy Forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93c966jNzYo). Pierre provides a broad survey of the challenges of data management and how Legend can help in addressing them.

Ffion Acland from Goldman Sachs also presented at the 2020 Open Source Strategy Forum, where she discussed [why open source data models revolutionize the financial industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rUm7dN9pfU). 

Both these videos are highly recommended.

# Hosted FINOS Legend Instance 

A good way to experiment with Legend is to try data modeling. The FINOS foundation hosts a shared instance of Legend that you can get access to.

Instructions to sign up and use this instance can be found on the [FINOS page](https://www.finos.org/legend).

# Install your own Legend

We are actively working on making it easy to install Legend on-premises or in the cloud.
