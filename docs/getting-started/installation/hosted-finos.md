This is the easiest way to get started with Legend as it does not involve any installation steps. 

The FINOS foundation hosts a free instance of Legend to be used for shared modeling efforts. 

Instructions to sign up and use this instance can be found on the [FINOS page](https://www.finos.org/legend).
